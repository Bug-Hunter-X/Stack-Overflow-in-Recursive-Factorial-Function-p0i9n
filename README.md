This repository contains a simple Hack program that demonstrates a stack overflow error. The program calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function. The recursive function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches the base case. If the input number is large enough, this can lead to a stack overflow error because the function will exceed the maximum recursion depth. This repository also includes a solution that uses an iterative approach to avoid the stack overflow error. The solution uses a loop to calculate the factorial of a number instead of using recursion.
